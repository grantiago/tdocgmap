# tdocgmap
Nice simple plugin that embeds kml files on a google map in joomla content.
source: [tdocplus](http://tdocplus.co.uk/0a_Empty400/kml-map)
will render multiple maps on one page. 

- Added en-GB language files for ease of formating text strings on admin page. 
- Translated  to spanish -- for Chiris. 
- Added a second tab group of options I would like to intigrage. 
- I can get the off on variable in the initmap script but it is in the wrong order. and has no effect.
- Removed the google maps api key in the leftover debugging. 
stuck here
